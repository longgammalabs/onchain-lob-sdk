# SDK

The [SDK](https://github.com/longgammalabs/onchain-lob-sdk) provides interfaces to communicate with the Onchain LOB API. 
Here is a description of the TypeScript version of the SDK.

The main object to start with is [`OnchainLobClient`](./OnchainLobClient.md).
It holds information about the Onchain LOB API endpoints and the user transaction signing interface.

All methods to interact with the spot market are available in the [`OnchainLobSpot`](./OnchainLobSpot.md) class.

The SDK also provides type and interface definitions for the objects used.
